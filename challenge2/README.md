# Challenge 2: Declaring Variables

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, you'll get practice declaring variables of different data types. You should do everything below in /src/main.js

## Requirements
1. Declare a variable that can never be assigned a new value:
    - Call it `javascript`
    - Give it the value `king`
    - Log this variable to the console
    - What type data type is this?
    - Which keyword did you use to define it? `let` or `const`
    - Try re-assigning a new value to it on the next line. What happens? (Once complete, you can remove this failed re-assignment)
2. Check to see if the `javascript` variable includes the word `hard`
    - Assign the result to a variable called `jsIsHard`
    - ***ðŸ’¡ HINT***: You can use the string method `includes` to check if a substring exists within a string. [See an example on W3 schools here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_includes.asp).
3. Declare another variable called `age`
    - Give it the value `12`
    - Console log it's value
    - Update the value to `13`
    - Console log the new value
4. Declare a variable called `isPreppingForExam`
    - Set it's value to `true`
    - Console log `isPreppingForExam`
5. Declare a variable called `isOlderThan8`
    - Give it a value of `age > 8`
    - Console log the result
    - What data type is it?
6. Finally, declare a variable called `thisVarHasNoValue`
    - Do NOT assign it a value
    - Console log `thisVarHasNoValue`
    - What is logged?

## What to Expect
You should have the following logged to the console:
```
king
false
false
12
13
true
true
```
